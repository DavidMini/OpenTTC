# Purpose
Submission for UofT Hacks IV. Developed with Angular and NPM. 

OpenTTC was based on the idea of being able to historically track your buses/street cars. In it's first iteration the website serves as a median for user's to compliment or complain to the ttc. By showing historical data of a bus arriving late or too early the consumer's have a tool that will be meaningful to TTC representatives to tackle these issues.

The end goal of such a project would be to focus on data trends and insight analytics. With enough historical data on transit times, it becomes apparent where the pain points of a commute becomes (and at what times they become a problem). Something like this can easily be used for consultation when trying to improve transit systems across cities.
